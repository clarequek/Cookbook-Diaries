# MOTIVATION 
Set against the backdrop of a fast-paced, technologically advanced society, Singaporeans have begun to adopt more convenient lifestyles in a multitude of aspects, prominently in their consumption habits. With the advent of food delivery platforms providing hot meals right at your doorstep, many Singaporeans no longer find a need to make home-cooked food themselves, rendering recipe books increasingly obsolete. As novice home cooks and avid enjoyers of local delights, Cookbook Diaries aims to encourage more Singaporeans to whip up their favourite treat, while demonstrating that cooking is not just a hobby for the skilled - it's a lifestyle that anyone can partake in, regardless of experience level. Cookbook Diaries makes it simple for you to select from a plethora of recipes, rated by difficulty level and purchase ingredients that you may not have from the nearest supermarket.
